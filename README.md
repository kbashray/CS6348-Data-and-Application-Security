# CS6348-Data-and-Application-Security

As a part of this project, you are asked to develop a secure and privacy-preserving application for handling sensitive data. 
Here are some suggestions:
Add security to some common cloud and data processing applications:
encryption support to Dropbox, so that you can encrypt files before it is stored at Dropbox,
encrypting google calendar, using encrypted web development framework Mylar (https://css.csail.mit.edu/mylar)
Other cloud apps that you may want to protect using access control and encryption
Testing some existing widely used data management products for security vulnerabilities (e.g., running some sql injection tests etc.) beyond already existing off-the-shelf tools (e.g., add a test that existing open source tools do not cover)
Develop a novel blockchain based solutions for accountable data sharing.
Test an interesting Internet of Things product for security and/or privacy by developing novel privacy attacks.
